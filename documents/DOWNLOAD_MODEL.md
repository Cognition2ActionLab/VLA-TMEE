# Model Downloading

Before starting the experiments, we recommend downloading the pretrained Qwen-VL models to a designated directory.
Run the following script:

```bash
python vla_tmee/utils/download_qwen3_vl_models.py
```

Alternatively, you can download the models locally using the following links:

- [Qwen3-VL-2B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-VL-2B-Instruct)
- [Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct)
